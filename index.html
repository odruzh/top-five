         <h1>The Top Five Detective Stories for Teenagers</h1>
           <article>
           <h2>Let's have fun!</h2>
           <p>Here's a list of five mystery books for children, old and new, that either inspired me while I was writing it or that I think you'll love if you enjoy adventures.</p>

               <h3>From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler by E. L. Konigsberg</h3>
               <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="img/konigsberg.jpg"   alt="Konigsberg"></td>
                        <td>The Guggenheim Mystery is about three kids who run away to solve a museum mystery. 
                            This is partly because when I was a kid one of my favourite books was From the Mixed-Up Files, 
                            which (funnily enough) is about two kids who run away and end up solving a museum mystery. 
                            It's set in the Met Museum, just down the road from the Guggenheim, and is narrated by one of the 
                            most brilliant main characters ever. If you secretly want to live in a museum and lead a more mysterious and exciting life, this book is for you.</td>

                <h3>Encyclopedia Brown, Boy Detective by Donald Sobol</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="img/sobol.jpg" alt="Sobol"></td>
                        <td> I love Encyclopedia Brown. He's a boy so smart that it seems like he's swallowed the encyclopedia (hence his name), 
                             and he solves small mysteries by noticing what is wrong with the stories he's being told. He's incredibly logical, 
                             and super detail-oriented, and I know my detective Ted would get along with him like a house on fire.</td>

                <h3>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="img/rowling.jpg" alt="Rowling"></td>
                        <td> I get asked a lot about which Harry Potter book is my favourite, and this is my answer. 
                             Why? Because it's the closest to a straight-up mystery story. Something is petrifying kids at Hogwarts, and Harry, 
                             Ron and Hermione (mostly Hermione, let's be honest) have to work out who's behind it. Detectives always work best as a group, 
                             and the best children's detective novels are about friendship as well as mystery.</td>

               <h3>The Ruby in the Smoke by Philip Pullman</h3>
               <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="img/pullman.jpg" alt="Pullman"></td>
                        <td>Sally Lockhart, The Ruby in the Smoke's hero, can run a business, ride like a Cossack 
                            (I never knew what this meant as a kid), shoot straight with a pistol and solve mysteries. She is also 16. I wanted to be Sally SO BADLY 
                            when I was younger, and I love these books. London is amazingly well-described, too â€“ I always really enjoy books that make you feel as 
                            though you could visit the places in them.</td>

               <h3>The Egypt Game by Zilpha Keatley Snyder</h3>
               <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="img/snyder.jpg" alt="Snyder"></td>
                        <td>This is a book about a group of kids in America who set up a secret society in which they pretend to be Ancient Egyptians. 
                            Then a real (and really awful) crime takes place in their neighbourhood, and the game starts to feel much more dangerous. 
                            I had secret societies as a kid (partly because of this book), and there's something really exciting about the idea of something made-up becoming 
                            totally real.</td>
                    </tr>
